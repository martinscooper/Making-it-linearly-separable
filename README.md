Visualizing the effect of linear and non-linear transformation
Martín Santillán Cooper

The goal of this notebook is to show how Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) can be seen as a succession of linear and non-linear transformation.

Despite the fact that MLPs are no more used by its own by Machine Learning practitioners, they usually are part of bigger networks that use fully connected layers merged with other newer techniques, such as convolutional and recurrent layers.
