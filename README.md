## Visualizing the effect of linear and non-linear transformations 

The goal of this notebook is to: 
* show how Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) can be seen as a succession of linear and non-linear transformation. 
* show how this succession of transformations can transform the datapoints of a given datasets into linearly separable datapoints.
